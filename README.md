# Google Ads Transparency Center Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing data from the Google Ads Transparency Center, which provides insights into advertising campaigns within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Turkey. The analysis aims to understand key metrics such as ad impressions, removal reasons, audience targeting strategies, and regional performance.

## Tools and Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize the data from the Google Ads Transparency Center. The following is a list of the primary tools and technologies employed:

### Data Extraction and Querying

- **SQL/BigQuery**: Used for extracting and querying the data from the Google Ads Transparency Center's `creative_stats` and `removed_creative_stats` tables.

### Data Cleaning and Analysis

- **Python/Jupyter Notebook**: Utilized for data cleaning tasks, such as flattening nested dictionaries, handling missing values, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis. Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy were likely employed for these tasks.

- **Excel**: Employed for additional data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis tasks that may have been more suitable for a spreadsheet-based approach.

### Visualization and Reporting

- **Tableau**: Leveraged for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to present the analysis findings in a clear and concise manner.

### Other Tools

- **Google Ads Transparency Center Presentation.pdf**: A PDF document containing the presentation slides that outline the project's objectives, data sources, methodology, findings, and recommendations.
